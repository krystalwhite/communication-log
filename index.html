      <p>Radio check. Pilot, please confirm.</p>
      <p>this is pilot confirming test. this studio sucks.</p>
      <p>Control here. I successfully pulled your work, so I'm feeling pretty good. I hope you it's smooth sailing from here.</p>
      <p>To keep with the theme of the assignment: Pilot, did NASA give you tasty astronaut food? Have you seen any interesting aliens yet?  :) </p>
      <p> Pilot here. NASA sent some ice cream, not at all like the real thing. No aliens yet, but keeping my eyes peeled.</p>
      <p>Control here. I've never had the Dippin Dots ice cream. It always looked weird to me and like the texture would be 
         strange and disappointing. But maybe that's me being judgmental without being willing to try it. 
         Also, just an FYI: my favorite ice cream flavor is raspberry/blackberry/vanilla swirl with chocolate chunks. Divine!</p>
      <p>Hopefully we find some aliens. My favorite ice cream flavor is chocolate.</p>
